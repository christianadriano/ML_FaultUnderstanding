If the data.length variable type is an integer more than a third of the maximum value and you multiply it by 3; then you will cause a problem with wrapping around to a negative. It would be better to divide by 2; then multiply by 3; but that still doesn't prevent a possible integer overflow from occurring.

You can do this by passing an unmodifiable Collection or Map. The Collections class provides methods to create an unmodifiable view of a Collection or Map. This view is not a copy of the original object but simply passes through all methods that don't change the contents of the object. All other methods will throw an UnsupportedMethodException. This limitation is true for the object itself; any iterators created from the object; as well as any Collections created (in the case of a Map).  Here are the methods to create unmodifiable objects:  Collection unmodifiableCollection(Collection c) List unmodifiableList(List l) Map unmodifiableMap(Map m) Set unmodifiableSet(Set s) SortedMap unmodifiableSortedMap(SortedMap s) SortedSet unmodifiableSortedSet(SortedSet s),1.414210608138E12,-,Female,1,7,usa,41

Try the thing and if it succeeds set that temporary variable to true; and then outside of the try/catch block return the temporary variable.
