Causality Discovery

The code here runs the d-variable Hilbert Schmidt independence criterion (dHSIC).
This method measures the dependency between variables. It is a non-parametric method,
hence it does not assume normality distribution.

large sample limit the value of dHSIC is 0 if the variables are jointly independent and 
positive if there is a dependence. See https://rdrr.io/cran/dHSIC/man/dhsic.html

#This means that Y and X in modelforw are not independent

dhsic.test(modelback$residuals,Y)$p.value
#[1] 0.000999001, statistically significant, hence Y and X in modelback ARE INDEPENDENT
