# ML_FaultUnderstanding

## Goal: 
investigate the factors that impact the accuracy of fault understanding. The analyzed factors are attributes of programmers (profession, year of experience) and tasks (duration, confidence).

## Data: 
Two experiments on identifying the code that is causing a software failure. 
Experiments:
* E1: 5405 tasks, 777 programmers, 10 real failures from 10 popular open source projects
* E2: 2580 tasks, 497 programmers, 8 real failures from 5 popular open source projects

## Analysis methods:
Experiments replication, descriptive statistics (ANOVA, Chi2square, Wilcoxon), correlation Analysis (Kendall-tau), predictive models (logistic regression,Random Forest).
